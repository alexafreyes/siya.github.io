    <h2>RECLAIM YOUR ROLE</h2>
    <h3>The Philippines has been praised as one fo the most accepting countries to the LGBT+ community and champions its inclusion of queer talent. However, while Filipino media is promoting many transgender artists, it still continues to occasionally fail at prime opportunities of inclusion. <br><br>We intend to highlight these shortcomings from recent Pinoy films that tell transgender stories but cast cisgender actors by placing potential transgender actors directly into the roles, therefore as a result, reclaiming them and putting the stories in their rightful places in queer storytelling.</h3>
